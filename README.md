# SceneKitUSDZSample

## Summary

I am trying to display a USDZ file in scene kit. It does not appear to be working.

## What did I do?`

From the Unity Asset Store, I got an asset and exported it as "Televisor_00.obj" and "material.lib", and used Reality Converter to convert it to USDZ.

Now I am loading it using ModelIO, and was expecting to see something. But: Nope.

## What am I asking?

Basically: Am I doing it wrong? Does the object need materials or editing, or is this the completely wrong way of going about this?
